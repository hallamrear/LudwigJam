# LudwigJam


Slider is a game I created for the Ludwig Jam with the theme being a Foddiian game. My approach to this was to make a game with an unconventional control scheme and a punishing failure. You use the mouse to control the player who slips and slides whenever they move on surfaces but can just an unlimited amount. Avoid touching the red platforms otherwise you'll have to start again. The game also includes an editor mode which I used to begin creating the level but eventually ran out of time so it unfinished but feel free to create your own level and share the save.txt file.

This project was the first project to include hTech (at the time it was called 'HalTec') which is a 2D game library I am working on.
